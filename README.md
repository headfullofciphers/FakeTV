## Description
This project purpose is to imitate TV as a simple line of defense against thieves and burglars

The thought is to imitate real TV switched on (implicitly – being watched) by changing color, brightness and flickering. It has to trick burglars that there are people at home.

The dea is to set a timer or perform few hours of 'lightning' after the dusk (discovered by light sensor).
